          I write about technology, crypto, and culture. My work explores the
          intersection of digital economies and human behavior.

        <p>
          With a background in both software engineering and digital economics,
          I've spent the last several years studying how new technologies are
          reshaping our social and economic landscape.

          Currently, I'm focused on exploring the future of digital identity,
          creator economies, and the evolution of online communities. I publish
          regular essays through my Substack publications: "The Metaverse is
          Coming" and "Avanthropology."

          When I'm not writing or coding, you can find me experimenting with
          generative art, collecting NFTs, or diving into the latest
          developments in blockchain and cryptocurrency.
